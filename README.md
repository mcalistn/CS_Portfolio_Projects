# CS Portfolio Projects

# CS-261 - Data Structures
Part 1 - Hash Map Implementation - Chaining
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement chaining for collision
resolution using a singly linked list. Chains of key / value pairs must be stored in
linked list nodes.
Part 2 - Hash Map Implementation - Open Addressing
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement Open Addressing
with Quadratic Probing for collision resolution inside that dynamic array. Key /
value pairs must be stored in the array.
