# CS-142 - Fundamentals I
This program processes an input file of data for a personality test known as the Keirsey Temperament Sorter. The Keirsey personality test involves answering 70 questions each of which have two answers. The input file will contain a series of line pairs, one per person. The first line will have the personâ€™s name (possibly including spaces) and the second line will have a series of 70 letters all in a row. The program computes the scores and overall result for each person and reports this information to an output file.

# CS-261 - Data Structures
Hash Map Implementation - Chaining
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement chaining for collision resolution using a singly linked list. Chains of key / value pairs must be stored in linked list nodes.

Hash Map Implementation - Open Addressing
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing for collision resolution inside that dynamic array. Key/value pairs must be stored in the array.

# CS-271 - Assembly Language
The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce concepts related to string primitive instructions and macros by:
 - Implementing and testing two macros for string processing.
 - Implementing and testing two procedures for signed integers which use string primitive instructions
 - Writing a test program (in main) which uses theses implementations to:
   - Get 10 valid integers from the user. 
   - Stores these numeric values in an array.
   - Display the integers, their sum, and their truncated average.
 
# CS-290 - Web Development
Create a MERN stack to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. Program uses React for the front-end UI app and REST API, using Node and Express, for the back-end web service. Program uses MongoDB for persistence.
