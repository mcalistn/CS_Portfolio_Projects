# CS Portfolio Projects

# CS-261 - Data Structures
Hash Map Implementation - Chaining
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement chaining for collision
resolution using a singly linked list. Chains of key / value pairs must be stored in
linked list nodes.

Hash Map Implementation - Open Addressing
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement Open Addressing
with Quadratic Probing for collision resolution inside that dynamic array. Key /
value pairs must be stored in the array.

# CS-271 - Assembly Language
The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce concepts related to string primitive instructions and macros by:
 - Implement and test two macros for string processing.
   - mGetString:  Display a prompt (input parameter, by reference), then get the userâ€™s keyboard input into a memory location (output parameter, by reference).
   - mDisplayString:  Print the string which is stored in a specified memory location (input parameter, by reference).
 - Implement and test two procedures for signed integers which use string primitive instructions
