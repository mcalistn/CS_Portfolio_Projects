# CS Portfolio Projects
  ---------------------

#

# CS-261 - Data Structures
Hash Map Implementation - Chaining
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement chaining for collision
resolution using a singly linked list. Chains of key / value pairs must be stored in
linked list nodes.

Hash Map Implementation - Open Addressing
 - Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement Open Addressing
with Quadratic Probing for collision resolution inside that dynamic array. Key /
value pairs must be stored in the array.

# CS-271 - Assembly Language
The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce concepts related to string primitive instructions and macros by:
 - Implementing and testing two macros for string processing.
 - Implementing and testing two procedures for signed integers which use string primitive instructions
 - Writing a test program (in main) which uses theses implementations to:
   - Get 10 valid integers from the user. 
   - Stores these numeric values in an array.
   - Display the integers, their sum, and their truncated average.
 
# CS-290 - Web Development
Create a MERN stack to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. Program uses React for the front-end UI app and REST API, using Node and Express, for the back-end web service. Program uses MongoDB for persistence.
